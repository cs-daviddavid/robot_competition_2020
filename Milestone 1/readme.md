# Milestone 1: Create your own code that moves the Zumo at least 4 feet.

* Out-of-the-box, my particular Zumo veers to the left by default if the left and right motor speeds are kept the same. I found that a ratio of 300:284 made my robot move straight.

* The line in the video measures 48in or 4ft.

* <details>
  <summary>Hint: Motor speeds</summary>
  
  ```
  Start out by testing with equal Left and Right Motor speeds.
  If the robot veers to the left, then the Left Motor should be given a higher speed.
  Else if the robot veers to the right, then the Right Motor should be given a higher speed.
  ```
