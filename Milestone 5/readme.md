Notes:
- Due to the dark floor, I did not get any success with the example solution. 
- I tried: 
(1) Adjusting the THRESHOLD to a higher value, but since the floor has black lines in it, the robot stops prematurely due to reading high values; 
(2) Modifying my code from Milestone 4, but the ballistic approach's small errors each turn adds up before the robot gets to the finish line;
(3) Putting the electrical tape on top of printer paper so that the robot never misinterprets the dark lines as the tape.
- Ultimately (3) got the robot to work as intended.
