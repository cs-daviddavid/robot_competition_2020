#Milestone 7: Have a final run in the practice maze of under XX seconds. (Will set this time once I have a practice maze up and running...)

Notes:
- My Milestone 6 code solved the maze in about 12 seconds. To improve on it, I adjusted the BASE_SPEED to 300. As a consequence, the robot tended to turn too much, so I adjusted the PROPORTION_GAIN to 0.13.
- Ultimately, my Milestone 7 got 10 seconds with the (comical) extra-looping around the finish line by the end of the video. In other trials, it got 8-9 seconds.
