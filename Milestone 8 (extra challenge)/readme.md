#Milestone 8 (extra challenge): For an extra challenge: Solve a maze with loops. This is a maze where there is at least one path that connects back to itself and the robot could take the same set of turns repeatedly.

Notes:
- Since my Milestone 7 had follow-the-left-wall code, it automatically solved a maze without loops as-it-is.
