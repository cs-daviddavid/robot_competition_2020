# Robot Competition (Vassar College)

This is a semester-long school project for a Robotics Competition in Vassar College (Cognitive Science 220 course).

"[COGS 220 is a course that] gives students with an interest in robotics an opportunity to explore basic principles of robot design and programming in a hands-on laboratory environment. The specific nature of the task to be accomplished varies each year, but in all cases the problems to be solved require thinking about the key issues that confront any robot designer: How is the robot situated in its environment? How does the design of the robotâ€™s body affect its intelligence? What are the optimal strategies for programming flexible intelligence in the robot (e.g., behavior-based or reactive systems, world modeling and planning systems, hybrid systems)? Students are organized into teams with balanced skill sets and compete to complete the assigned task most effectively in an end-of-semester competition. The design and construction components of the course are supported by classroom instruction in basic electronics, hardware design and building techniques, and relevant programming skills.

## Requirements
Hardware:
* (1) Arduino UNO
* (1) Pololu ZUMO Robot Kit
* (1) Pololu Micro Gear Motor set of 2
* (4) AA Batteries
* (1) Roll of black electrical tape

Software:
* Download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)
* Basic C++ knowledge

## Milestones

This project is divided into easy-to-follow milestones. The source codes provided are optimized for dark wood flooring with dark lines; however, if your floor is even darker than the one I optimized to, either some variables may have to be adjusted or putting plain white paper underneath the tape could let the robot run as intended.
